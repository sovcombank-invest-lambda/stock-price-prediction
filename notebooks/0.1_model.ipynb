    "As we can see from the data above, this model struggles to accurately predict the change in the opening price of the Dow Jones Instrustial Average. Given that its median average error is 74.15 and the interquartile range of the actual price change is 142.16 (87.47 + 54.69), this model is about as good as someone who knows the average price change of the Dow. \n",

    "- The market is arguably to be a random walk. Although there is some direction to its movements, there is still quite a bit of randomness to its movements.\n",
    "- The news that we used might not be the most relevant. Perhaps it would have been better to use news relating to the 30 companies that make up the Dow.\n",
    "- More information could have been included in the model, such as the previous day(s)'s change, the previous day(s)'s main headline(s). \n",
    "- Many people have worked on this task for years and companies spend millions of dollars to try to predict the movements of the market, so we shouldn't expect anything too great considering the small amount of data that we are working with and the simplicity of our model."
